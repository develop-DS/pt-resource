    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how your data is handled when you use the app "<strong>Gradski Prevoz Novi Sad</strong>" (the "App").</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>The App itself does not collect, store, or share any personal data. However, the App uses third-party services that may collect data as described below.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App integrates the following third-party services, which may collect certain types of data to provide their functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Google Maps:</strong> Used to display maps and provide location-based services. When you enable location permissions, Google Maps may collect data about your location. For details on how Google Maps handles your data, please review the <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Google AdMob:</strong> Used to display advertisements in the App. These advertisements are non-personalized, meaning they are not based on your personal data or preferences.

This feature is optional, and you can choose to enable or disable location permissions through your device settings. Location data is not stored or transmitted by the App itself.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect or store any user data. Any data collected by third-party services (such as Google Maps or AdMob) is used to provide their respective services, such as displaying maps or serving ads.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect any data from children.</p>
